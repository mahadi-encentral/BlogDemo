## Description
You are to implement a simple social media application where a user can register, sign in  with the registered username and password, create post, and comment under each post.
Only a registered and signed In user can see the post in the application, and be able to comment under. Using querydsl you should be able to get every post in the application, as well as every comment in each post.

Then create a 5mins video showing your code implementation and explaining how you implemented the tasks


## Required methods:
* Create a database to hold the records of the Users
* Create a User (persist to the dB)
* Create a post(persist to the dB)
* Create a comment under a post(persist to the dB)

Write test cases for your implementations 



## NB:
- Your project must be a maven project.
- Write tests to cover all the methods to be written, before development begins. 
- Make logical assumptions where necessary.
